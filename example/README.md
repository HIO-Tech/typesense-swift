# Typesense swift example

I have created two simple apps to demonstrate how typesense-swift works. There's a SwifUI version and a UIKit version. The SwiftUI Version is a much more elaborate application than the UIKit version but both illustrate the intended usage of the typesense-swift package.

The application is a Recipe Search ü•ò app and typesense manages to search through over 2 Million records in no time ‚ö°Ô∏è You can checkout the web variant of typesense recipe search [here](https://recipe-search.typesense.org)
